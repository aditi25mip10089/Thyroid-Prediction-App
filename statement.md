## Problem Statement
Thyroid disease recurrence is a significant clinical challenge, as patients may develop recurrent disease years after initial treatment.  
Predicting recurrence typically requires extensive follow‑up, imaging, biopsies, and physician expertise.  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that analyzes structured patient data—demographic, clinical, pathological, and staging variables—to estimate the probability of recurrence, enabling earlier risk assessment and improved care planning.

## Scope of the Project
- Utilize historical thyroid disease patient records to train a supervised machine learning model.
- Support binary classification: **Recurred (Yes/No)**.
- Perform preprocessing, one-hot encoding, train-test split, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- Allow individual patient prediction through structured feature input.
- Provide interpretable and probability‑based outputs to support decision-making.
- Intended for research, academic, and decision‑support purposes—not direct clinical diagnosis.

## Target Users
- Medical researchers studying thyroid disease outcomes
- Data scientists and ML engineers working on healthcare prediction models
- Oncology departments exploring clinical decision-support tools
- Medical students and academic institutions learning applied ML in healthcare
- Hospital IT teams developing risk‑stratification systems

*Not intended for use by patients or as a standalone diagnostic tool.*
